The Data Visualization project focuses on transforming raw data into meaningful and visually appealing insights using interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards. The goal is to present complex datasets in a way that is easy to understand and actionable for decision-making.

The project involves the use of modern data visualization tools and libraries such as Tableau, Power BI, or programming libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, or D3.js. By implementing intuitive designs, this project allows users to explore trends, patterns, and relationships within the data through interactive elements like filters, tooltips, and dynamic views.
